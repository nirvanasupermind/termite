# Termite: The ternary computer emulator
Termite is a RISC CPU architecture, emulated in C++11, that extensively uses a *ternary* (base 3) numeral system, an alternative basis for data representation in contrast to the prevailing binary system. 

## Documentation
See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) (incomplete) for the documentation, and see [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md) for the plan/outline.

## Status
Currently, the architecture is mostly finalized, and the RAM and decoder have been implemented, but the processor itself has yet to be implemented.

There are future plans to include a compiled programming language for ternary software development, although it has not been implemented nor planned out yet.

<!-- Termite is a stack-based virtual machine based on balanced ternary arithmetic, implemented in C++11. 

This project is very much a work-in-progress, and currently, the virtual machine is unfinished. Future plans include a toolchain featuring a lightweight operating system and compiled programming language for ternary software development, although neither have been implemented or planned out yet.

## What is balanced ternary?
Unlike the prevailing binary representation, a balanced ternary integer is in base 3, and each digit can have the values 1, 0, or âˆ’1. Since it is inconvenient to write -1 as a digit, the letter "T" is often used as a substitute. For example, decimal 11 = 3^2 + 3^1 - 3^0, thus it can be written as "11T". -->
