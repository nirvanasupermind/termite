# Termite
Termite an open-source ternary RISC CPU emulator in C++11. It uses the ternary numeral system and three-valued ternary logic instead of the two-valued binary logic prevalent in other computers, using a binary-coded ternary or BCT data representation.

# Status
There were two previous iterations of Termite, but they were scrapped and reset due to having complex and hard-to-implement architectures. There is no implementation progress on the current iteration, only planning.
