# Termite
Termite an open-source emulator for a balanced ternary RISC CPU architecture in C++11. Unlike the prevailing binary representation, a balanced ternary integer is in base 3, and each digit can have the values 1, 0, or âˆ’1. This system allows for more efficient reuse of data, and has higher security due to being wholly incompatible with existing infrastructure. Balanced ternary data may be stored on binary computers using binary-coded ternary (BCT), where each ternary digit (or trit) is encoded as two bits.
# Status
There were two previous iterations of Termite, but they were scrapped and reset due to having complex and hard-to-implement architectures. The current implementation has operations for 3-trit trybbles and 6-trit trytes working, although 18-trit words have not been implemented.
