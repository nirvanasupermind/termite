# Termite
Termite an open-source ternary RISC CPU emulator in C++11. It uses ternary logic (i.e., base 3), with *trits* that can be `0`, `1` or `2`,s instead of the more common binary system (i.e., base 2) in its calculations.

# Status
There were two previous iterations of Termite, but they were scrapped and reset due to having complex and hard-to-implement architectures. There is no implementation progress on the current iteration, only planning.
