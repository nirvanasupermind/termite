# Termite
Termite a ternary RISC CPU architecture emulator in C++11. Unlike the prevailing binary representation, a ternary integer is in base 3, and each digit can have the values 0, 1, or 2. This system allows for more efficient reuse of data, and has higher security due to being wholly incompatible with existing infrastructure. Ternary data may be stored on binary computers using binary-coded ternary (BCT), where each ternary digit (or trit) is encoded as two bits.
# Status
There were three previous iterations of Termite, but they were scrapped and reset due to being difficult to pipeline.
