# Termite
Termite an open-source emulator for a ternary RISC CPU architecture in C++11. It uses the balanced ternary numeral system and three-valued ternary logic instead of the two-valued binary logic prevalent in other computers, so it has three memory cell states (-1, 0, 1) as opposed to the usual two (0, 1).

# Status
There were two previous iterations of Termite, but they were scrapped and reset due to having complex and hard-to-implement architectures. There is no implementation progress on the current iteration, only planning.
