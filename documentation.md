# Ternary Logic and Arithmetic
Terrnary computers use the ternary (base 3) system rather than the more common binary (base 2) system. In the balanced ternary system, there are three digits, {-1, 0, 1}, in contrast to binary's two or decimal's ten, and each place represents a power of 3. (In Termite, capital T is used to represent -1 as it does not have it's own symbol.) For example, the string "11T" in balanced ternary represents 1 * 3<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 3<sup>1</sup> + (-1) * 3<sup>0</sup>, or 11 in decimal.
