# Number representation
Termite uses 12-trit integers and 24-trit floating-point numbers. Since floating-point numbers take up 2 words of space, floating-point intructions use odd-numbered registers only  â€“ for example, passing `r1` to a floating-point instruction will impliticly specify a floating-point number whose hi word is `r1` and lo word is `r2`.
# Processor architecture
## Memory
The 12-trit word size enables access to 531,441 words of memory. The top 19,683 words in the memory space (from `0n444444` downwards) are reserved for the system, giving 511,758 words for programming.

## CPU registers
The CPU contains 9 general-purpose 12-trit registers (r0 to r8). r8 is the program counter (PC), and r7 is the stack pointer (SP).
