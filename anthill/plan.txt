Types:
Statically typed language

void 
char or int8 = 8-trit integer
int or int16 = 16-trit integer
[most likely removed]
long or int32 = 32-trit integer
fixed or fixed32 = 32-trit fixed-point with scaling factor 3^16 
float or float32 = 32-trit floating pobnt (alternative to fixed, probably will use fixed instead since it's simpler)

Pointers for any types supporting pointer-based array (except void* is unlikely to be included)
char is used for ternary boolean, char* is used for string

Features:
Variable definition and assignments
If statements
For statements
While statements
Functions
Pointers and pointer arithmetic

Standard library features:


Assembly register allocations:
r-13 = First argument for operators; used for return value of any operators or to load literals/variables
r-12 = Second argument for operators
r-11 = General temporary

Example program:

int fac(int x) {
    if(x <= 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return x * fac(x - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    print_int(fac(5));
    return 0;
}
