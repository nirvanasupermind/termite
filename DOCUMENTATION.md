<!-- # Ternary mathematics
The ternary number system is a positional numeral system employing 3 as the base and so requiring three discrete states for its digits (or "trits"), 0, 1, and 2, in contrast to the widespread binary system (i.e., base 2).  For example, the number `23` in decimal is written as `212` in the ternary system, as it is equal to `2*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0`. 

Negative numbers may be represented using the 3's complement system, analogous to the binary 2's complement system. To negate a 3's complement number, subtract each trit from 2, then add 1 to the resulting number. For example, the three's complement of `022` (representing +7) is `200 + 1` or `201` (representing -7).

Binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, in which each trit is represented by two bits, can be used to simulate ternary computers using binary computers. The most common BCT encoding is to encode the trit `0` as `00`, the trit `1` as `01`, and the trit `2` as `10`.

<!-- # Ternary numeral system
The *ternary* (base 3) system represents all numbers by a sequence of trits (ternary digits), which in turn may be represented by `0`, `1` or `2`. For example, the number `41` in decimal is written as `1112` in ternary, as it is equal to `1*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0`. 

# Binary-coded ternary (BCT)
Ternary data may be stored on binary computers via the binary-coded-ternary (BCT) system, where each trit is encoded by two bits (`00` for the trit `0`, `01` for the trit `1`, and `10` for the trit `2`).
