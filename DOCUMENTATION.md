# Ternary numeral system
The *ternary* (base 3) system represents all numbers by a sequence of trits (ternary digits), which in turn may be represented by `0`, `1` or `2`. For example, the number `41` in decimal is written as `1112` in ternary, as it is equal to `1*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0`. 

# Binary-coded ternary (BCT)
Ternary data may be stored on binary computers via the binary-coded-ternary (BCT) system, where each trit is encoded by two bits (`00` for the trit `0`, `01` for the trit `1`, and `10` for the trit `2`).

# Heptavigesimal numeral system
The *heptavigesimal* (base 27) system may be used to compactly write ternary numbers as text
